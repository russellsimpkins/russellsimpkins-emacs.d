so here is the documentation for the Chase Paymentech Orbital Gateway: http://download.chasepaymentech.com/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_226_1595_0_0_18/Orbital_Gateway_XML_Specification.pdf
the stuff on profiles is most useful
the financial API will essentially be our gateway to talk to chase
we will be using it to authorie new credit cards and perform settlement transactions
I was thinking maybe you delve into the first part of it since it'll
be needed for the import of existing credit cards
here is wii describing the calls you can expect to receive from Billy's API with some other basic assumptions: http://wiki.em.nytimes.com/dev/doku.php?id=user_prefs:sad:e-commerce:financial-api
It does not contain much detail about the integration with Chase
but I am assuming we'll be using the authorize method which creates a payment profile after successful authorization.  
here is where you can find the sdk Chase provides and docs on that:
http://download.chasepaymentech.com/
finally, the very rudimentary stubs I have in place thus far are in svn under sartre/financial-api/branches/initial-dev.  Feel free to branch from there if you'd like.  The ProfileResource should correspond to the payment profile stuff I mentioned
I'll be fleshing out the TransactionResource
let me know if you have any questions.
Are you familiar with JAX-RS and jersey?
