	Dig up javascript routine to do fancy select
I'm really not comfortable with this UI - I'm having a hard time resolving how this will work for the user (and technically) when you don't have a clear spot for the selected people to go to. It appears that you watn popel eto just click on each button to select the recipients, but we also allow the user to seaarch and limit recipients - if i select 10 people, and then add in text to limit the entire result set, we may be able to remember who is a recipent, but the user won't see those users. I think we need some way to visually add people to a list maybe under the line of people, we put something like: Selected
